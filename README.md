### Remove all Zimbra Users from Nextcloud

If the administrator remove the Nextcloud App the Zimbra users will not be visible anymore in the
Nextcloud administration panel.

**Note** To manually disable the authentication through Zimbra remove these lines to the Nextcloud configuration:
```php
'user_backends' => array (
 0 => array (
   'class' => 'OC_User_Zimbra',
   'arguments' => array(),
 ),
),
```

**WARNING:** This process will delete all the Zimbra Users data from Nextcloud and is not reversible.

To remove all the Zimbra Users from the Nextcloud installation run this command:
```bash
cd /var/www/nextcloud # Go to the OCC path
mysql_pwd='password'  # Set the database password
occ_db='nextcloud'    # Set the database name for the Nextcloud

mysql -u root --password="${mysql_pwd}" "${occ_db}" -N -s \
    -e 'SELECT `uid` FROM `oc_zimbradrive_users`' \
    | while read uid; do \
        sudo -u www-data php ./occ user:delete "${uid}"; \
        mysql -u root --password="${mysql_pwd}" "${occ_db}" \
            -e "DELETE FROM oc_accounts WHERE uid = '${uid}' LIMIT 1"; \
      done
```
